Notes:
mkdir & create seem to have an error involving making sibling files..
This causes the oldest sibling to cause the younger to be corrupted in some manner.
Below is what I understand to happen.

Nesting dirs work, if dir1 exists, I can go in and make dir2 fine
Sibling dirs break the younger siblings.
Dir1 can exist and work fine, but if dir2 is made, dir1 breaks.
It causes a loop when I ls into dir1, and I seem unable to make new dirs inside it.
This loop can also break dir2 somehow.
If I have dir1 & dir2, and makde dir3, 4, and onward. dir2 and up will stop being dirs. Except the oldest. 

The oldest siblings are corrupting the youngest.
This is also interfering with the time stored in the files.
LS lists everything as if its a directory, and lists all times to be identical for some reason.
This was NOT a problem with the original implementation of LS using hte provided database. This means that the one I am making is being broken by my file creations.
Using LS on a file shows different information than LS being used on its own.


Edit: retesting ls on the original disk image does show the same issue.
